# Accessibility Services Overview

*Originally designed for screen readers frequently used by individuals with visual impairments.*

## The Permission

> The Accessibility Services permission is among the most sensitive in the Android system. It should only be granted with complete confidence, as these services can access **every element** displayed in **any app**â€”including **browsers** and **banking applications**.

I assure you that I will not access any of your personal data except for detecting the Reels/Shorts layout and initiating actions such as navigating the feed or pressing the back button. For complete transparency, please review the source code on GitHub: [Blokky](https://github.com/ronjar/Blokky). If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email me at blokky@robingebert.com.
